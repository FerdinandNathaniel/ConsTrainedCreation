## Interview Abigail

**Question: experience effect constraints**

**Question: experience difference between constraints**

- Some constraints were really helpful.
- 5 minutes was short
- More time would help be more creative, get more out of the constraints
- time was too constraining (negatively impacting creativity) at 5min, 10min was better
- it was fun to do, which helped in being creative
- visual constraints really worked well (especially colour and shades)
- time was not positive/negative on its own
- constraints made her move different from her natural pattern

**Question: experience difference constraints vs no-constraints**

- automatically started constraining herself in order to get started
- gave herself a constraint
- very different type of constraint she gave herself
- used well known/pre-trained patterns/movements to start, which may have made her less creative

## Interview Deliah

**Question: experience effect constraints**

**Question: experience difference between constraints**

- really excited to start
- first constraints (lab 1) were very exciting, later ones less effort put in
- did it later in the evening
- worked better with visual constraint and a narrative one (easier to follow, could relax)
- mood/energy affected how well certain constraints worked
- having various constraints worked well
- colour can be very inspiring
- maybe one day a constraint can inspire but other day not
- constraints were interesting starting points
- wondered for more ways to deal with these constraints
- how to record yourself dancing to improve yourself/find new ways to deal with the constraints for revisiting them

**Question: experience difference constraints vs no-constraints**

- went back to usual pattern and see from there what happened
- figured out a constraint on her own to get started
- went into 'class mode'
- was pretty difficult
- easier to start with constraints, makes task clear, and what you can use
- was nice in between though, perhaps as creative 'pallette cleanser'

## Interview Maya

**Question: experience effect constraints**

**Question: experience difference between constraints**

- easier with image or text, much more connected and creativity more stimulated
- sounds (not music) were distracting, puzzling how to go about it, not very inviting
  - could also be a problem to solve so also could help to be creative, but did not work out
- short sound constraints didn't work because her mind couldn't wrap itself around it, couldn't grasp it
- constraints felt like a framework to fit movement knowledge on, helped in being creative
- more time needed to engage with creativity
- more complex (informative) constraint may inhibit creativity, because it becomes too specific, constraints too manufactured, that not much can be changed, then for some people it may work and for other not. simple colour was more inviting

**Question: experience difference constraints vs no-constraints**

- no constraints were more difficult to put her movement knowledge into the frame
- ideas emptied out
- looked at environment for more stimuli to get thoughts/ideas going
- gave up because of time constraint
- in different environment (live studio) would have gone further to try and still making it work
- needed stimuli to get started (which could also take the form of people around or different environment)
